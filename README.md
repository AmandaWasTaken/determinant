Another silly side "project" I made instead of doing school work  
Computes the determinant of a given matrix (only supports 2x2 and 3x3 for now but more will come soontm)

# Build
make (if you have make)
else: gcc -o programName programName.c (if you use clang instead i'm sure you know how to do it with that)

# Usage
./programName (size (2 or 3))
input values of indices one at a time
